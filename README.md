# Crop Recommendation Project

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict suitable crops based on environmental factors. The implemented algorithms include Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to recommend crops for agricultural purposes by analyzing key environmental factors. The dataset consists of the following features:

- N (Nitrogen)
- P (Phosphorus)
- K (Potassium)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall

The response variable is the type of crop.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost (if using XGBoost)

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost
